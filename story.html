        <h1>Summary of The Bet</h1>
        <p>15 years ago, a group of people were discussing about which of death penalty and long-term imprisonment were more humane. A banker said that death penalty was more humane as it kills instantly compared to imprisonment which only slowly kills, but a lawyer said otherwise because he thinks it's always better to live than die. The banker then made a bet: he would bet 2 millions for 15 years of solitary confinement of the lawyer.</p>
        <p>The lawyer was allowed to play instruments, read books, write letters, drink wine, and smoke. In the first year, the lawyer played the piano, and in the second year, the lawyer read classics. Eventually, the lawyer started drinking wine and started studying languages, philosophy, and history. He wrote a letter to the banker about how he was happy learning the languages of other regions. After the tenth year, the lawyer started reading the Gospel for a whole year. Then, he asked for books of a broad variety, including chemistry, natural sciences, and Shakespeare.</p>

        <p>Then, the story went back to the present. The banker was in debt from stocks, and he was about to pay the 2 millions to the lawyer. Therefore, he decided to kill the lawyer. He crept into the lodge and noticed the lawyer sitting motionless at the table. He also noticed a letter written by the lawyer and started reading it. The letter said that after years of confinement, the lawyer actually started despising life. He argued that earthly properties like wisdom and wealth will be wiped due to the presence of death, and that the banker had exchanged heaven for earth. He planned to leave the lodge five hours before the fixed time and renounce the two millions. </p>
        <p>The banker was moved by the letter, and he felt contempt about losing in the stock exchange for the first time. The lawyer left the lodge on the next day, and the banker secured the letter in his fireproof safe.</p>
