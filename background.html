    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <img src="images/chekhov.jpg" alt="Anton Chekhov" style="float: right;">
    <p>Anton Chekhov was a Russian playwright and short story writer. Born in 1860, he was a prolific writer of short stories and plays. His works often explored themes of human nature, social issues, and the complexities of life in 19th-century Russia.</p>

    <p>The story was written at the period under the rule of Tsar Alexander III. That was a time where political repression and social changes are taking place. While Alexander II implemented reforms in government and education, Alexander III reversed many of these reforms and instead rule much more conservatively and strictly. Being a writer at that time, Chekhov mainly wrote stories that critique this societal condition. In the beginning of <i>The Bet</i>, a question about capital punishment is raised. Although this question is out of scope in this analysis, it notes the relation between the story and the political condition of the time.</p>
