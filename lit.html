        <h1>Themes</h1>
        <h2>The Meaning of Life</h2>
        <p>In "The Bet," the central question revolves around the meaning of life. The banker believes that life in prison is unbearable and that the lawyer will break, while the lawyer seeks to prove that spiritual freedom through knowledge is superior to material wealth. Through his 15 years of confinement, the lawyer discovers that life is ultimately meaningless, as he renounces the money and declares all worldly pursuits futile. This highlights the existential theme that true meaning may lie in intellectual and spiritual pursuits, yet even those can lead to disillusionment. The lawyer's journey from youthful idealism to profound cynicism illustrates how prolonged isolation and deep study can strip away illusions, revealing the absurdity of human existence and the futility of seeking ultimate truths in a material world.</p>
        <h2>Greed and Idealism</h2>
        <p>The theme of greed focuses more on the banker. The banker represents greed, driven by his desire to win the bet and preserve his fortune, even at the cost of the lawyer's life. He is materialistic and cynical. In contrast, the lawyer embodies idealism, believing that human dignity and the pursuit of knowledge are worth more than money. His idealism leads him to endure imprisonment, but ultimately, his idealism crumbles as he realizes the emptiness of life, forcing him to reject the material reward. The banker's willingness to wager two million rubles on the lawyer's failure underscores his obsession with wealth and control, while the lawyer's initial enthusiasm for the bet reflects a naive faith in human potential. This clash highlights how greed can corrupt moral judgment, and idealism, when confronted with harsh realities, can dissolve into despair.</p>
        <h2>Freedom and Imprisonment</h2>
        <p>The story explores the paradox of freedom and imprisonment. Physically imprisoned, the lawyer achieves intellectual freedom through books, gaining wisdom and enlightenment. Conversely, the banker, though free, is imprisoned by his greed and fear. The lawyer's final letter reveals that true imprisonment is in the illusions of the world, while physical confinement can liberate the mind. This theme underscores that freedom is not merely physical but spiritual and intellectual. The lawyer's 15-year isolation allows him to transcend bodily constraints, accessing universal knowledge, yet this freedom ultimately imprisons him in a cycle of disillusionment. The banker's external freedom is illusory, bound by societal expectations and material desires, illustrating Chekhov's commentary on the subjective nature of liberty.</p>

        <h1>Literary Devices</h1>
        <h2>Allusion to Jesus</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <p class="quote">Then after the tenth year, the prisoner sat immovably at the table and read nothing but the Gospel. It seemed strange to the banker that a man who in four years had mastered six hundred learned volumes should waste nearly a year over one thin book easy of comprehension.</p>
            <p class="quote">He was a skeleton with the skin drawn tight over his bones, with long curls like a woman’s and a shaggy beard.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Analysis</summary>
                <p>The story alluded to Christianity in these two sections by mentioning the Gospel. In particular, the description of the lawyer's apparance in the second quote resembles the common description of Jesus Christ's image. This allusion relates the realization of the lawyer to the Christian concept of renouncing worldly pleasures and focusing instead on spiritual enlightment out of life.</p>

        <h2>Metaphor</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <p class="quote">The geniuses of all ages and of all lands speak different languages, but the same flame burns in them all. Oh, if you only knew what unearthly happiness my soul feels now from being able to understand them!</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Analysis</summary>
                <p>In the first letter wrote by the lawyer, the lawyer metaphorically insists that the "same flame" burns inside all the geniuses who have ever existed. Here, the flame refers to artistic spirit and  demonstrates how the lawyer was able to experience "heavenly happiness" through books even while cut off from the outside world. It also shows how confinement may still include connections to the world. Yet it is worth noting that the lawyer still lost interest in this at the end of the story.</p>

        <h2>List of Three</h2>
        <div class="card">
            <p class="quote">And I despise your books, I despise wisdom and the blessings of this world. It is all worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive, like a mirage.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>Analysis</summary>
                <p>In the letter to the banker, the lawyer described the blessings of the world as "worthless, fleeting, illusory, and deceptive". Here, the adjectives used to describe the nature of worldly pleasures act as emphasis on how the lawyer made a complete transformation on how he viewed life.</p>
